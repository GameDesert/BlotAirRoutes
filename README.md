# BlotAirRoutes
Flightpath mapper for Blot (Hackclub).

Inspired by Langlands and Bell (http://www.langlandsandbell.com/portfolio-item/air-routes-of-the-world-night-day-2002/)

Airport DB sourced from OpenFlights (openflights.org).

Due to editor limitations, the script for generating the polylines from airport lists and the script for actually drawing those polylines are separate.
